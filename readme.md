# Service Agreement

![markdown and pdf screenshot](_img/screenshot.png)

This is a legal agreement for my design services that I had drafted a by a former Director of Legal at a creative agency. Over the years I've rewritten parts of it myself for various projects and I've had other lawyers review it as well.

I got tired of painfully editing a Microsoft word document each time, so I reformatted everything in markdown to work with iA Writer's variables.

## How to use it
1. Use [iA writer](https://ia.net/writer) to edit `service-agreement.md`
2. Edit the variables at the top of `service-agreement.md` to update the agreement details.
3. Update the Exhibit A and B sections, which include the statement of work, payment schedule, list of deliverables, etc.
4. Export as a PDF from iA writer. See `service-agreement.pdf` for a demo.
